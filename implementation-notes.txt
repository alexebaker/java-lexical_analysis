IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR SPIKE1

TO REGEX OR NOT TO REGEX

 - Regular expressions are certainly one possible way to approach
   spike1 lexical analysis, and you can use them if you want to, but
   you should note the following points.

 - The spike1 lexical analysis can be performed with no more than one
   byte lookahead and no backtracking -- with some care taken to
   observe RULE 2 (s1.3.1.1.2) -- so regexes are somewhat overkill.

 - Lexical analysis is usually expressed in terms of byte-at-a-time
   processing, but regular expressions generally require entire lines
   to be read up front.  This can create various edge and corner case
   problems, not least of which involving the location of EOF.
